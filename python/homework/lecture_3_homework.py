# If the score is 90 or higher, print: "Great job! You scored an A.".
# If the score is 80 or higher, print: "Good work! You scored a B.".
# If the score is 70 or higher, print: "Not bad! You scored a C.".
# If the score is 60 or higher, print: "You passed! You scored a D.".
# If the score is below 60, print: "You failed the exam. Better luck next time.".
