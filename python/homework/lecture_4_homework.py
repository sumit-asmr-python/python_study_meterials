# ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements of assignments ‚ö†Ô∏è
# At the top the file write you git user id ex: "@sumit-dev-01"
# 1. When you start your assignment, make sure you have to record your current work. If you on any system like windows or mac, you have start your screen recording.
# 2. Submit your work to "origin/assignments"
# 3. Submit your recording to "sumitpaul@cloudadda.net"
# 4. Follow this procedures to get a classmate note book üìí, if you successfully completed that assignment
# 5. When you start you assignment don't shift to another window, do not open any lecture file. Just answer the question, and submit your assignment to early mentioned destination.
# 6. Submit your raw recorded file, make sure that is not modified or edited...edited file not accepted üö´
# 7. When you write your code and run that successfully, then "comment off" that code so that code would be ignored by python interpreter, when you run your next code. Because you can write multiple types of code on a single file. And saved your work securely because your code is checked by me" 

# Q.1  Define what a function is and explain its importance in programming.

# Q.2 Write a Python function calculate_area that takes two arguments (length and width) and returns the area of a rectangle.

# Q.3 Explain the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments in functions. Provide an example.

# Q.4  What is the difference between a return statement and a print statement in a function?

# Q.5 Consider the following code snippet:

def greet(name, message="Hello"):
    return f"{message}, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
print(greet("Bob", "Hi"))

# What will be the output of the above program? Explain. 

# Q.6 Explain with an example what a lambda function is and when it might be used.

# Q.7 What is recursion? Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

# Q.8 Identify and fix the error in the following code:

def multiply(a, b):
    print(a * b)
result = multiply(4, 5)
print(result)


# Q.9 How do you define a function in Python that accepts a variable number of arguments? Provide an example function.

# Q.10 Write a Python function is_prime that takes an integer as input and returns True if the number is prime, otherwise False.

# Advanced Questions: Functions

# Q.1 Write a Python function fibonacci_recursive(n) that generates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. Explain how your function works and analyze its time complexity.

# Q.2 Create a Python function find_longest_word(sentence) that accepts a string sentence and returns the longest word in the sentence. If there are multiple words of the same length, return the first one. Include exception handling to deal with cases where the input is not a string.

# Q.3 Write a Python function apply_discount(cart, discount_func) that takes a list of item prices (cart) and a discount function (discount_func). The discount_func should be a user-defined function passed as an argument. Demonstrate its use by applying a 10% discount to each item in the cart.

# Q.4 Implement a Python function parse_expression(expression) that evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string (e.g., "3 + 5 * 2 - 8"). Your function must handle multiple operations and follow the correct order of precedence without using eval().

# Q.5 Create a function matrix_multiply(A, B) to multiply two 2D matrices A and B. Ensure your function validates the input matrices for compatibility and raises an appropriate error if multiplication is not possible.

# Q.6 Write a Python function decorator_logger(func) that acts as a decorator to log the execution time of any function it decorates. Demonstrate this with a sample function that sorts a large list.

# Q.7 Define a function generate_combinations(items, r) that generates all possible combinations of r items from a given list items without using the itertools module. Explain its use case and complexity.

# Q.8 Write a function schedule_tasks(tasks) that accepts a list of tasks (as tuples of task name and duration) and returns an optimized schedule sorted by shortest duration first. Add a parameter to allow sorting in descending order if specified.

# Q.9  Implement a function nested_dict_sum(nested_dict) that takes a dictionary, which may contain other dictionaries, and calculates the sum of all numeric values in the entire structure. Handle edge cases where the values may be non-numeric.

# Q.10  Write a Python function custom_sort(data, key_func) that sorts a list of dictionaries based on a user-provided key function. Demonstrate its use with a list of dictionaries representing employees, sorting by their age and then by salary.
