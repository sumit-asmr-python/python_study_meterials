# ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements of assignments ‚ö†Ô∏è
# At the top the file write you git user id ex: "@sumit-dev-01"
# 1. When you start your assignment, make sure you have to record your current work. If you on any system like windows or mac, you have start your screen recording.
# 2. Submit your work to "origin/assignments"
# 3. Submit your recording to "sumitpaul@cloudadda.net"
# 4. Follow this procedures to get a classmate note book üìí, if you successfully completed that assignment
# 5. When you start you assignment don't shift to another window, do not open any lecture file. Just answer the question, and submit your assignment to early mentioned destination.
# 6. Submit your raw recorded file, make sure that is not modified or edited...edited file not accepted üö´
# 7. When you write your code and run that successfully, then "comment off" that code so that code would be ignored by python interpreter, when you run your next code. Because you can write multiple types of code on a single file. And saved your work securely because your code is checked by me" 


# QUESTIONS:-

# 1. Write a Python program that uses a while loop to traverse through a list of integers and print the sum of all even numbers in the list.
# 2. Given a list of strings, write a Python program to find the longest string in the list using a for loop.
# 3. Using a for loop, write a Python program that counts the number of occurrences of the number 5 in a list of integers.
# 4. Create a program that takes a list of words and reverses the order of the list using a while loop. Print the modified list.
# 5. Write a program that uses a for loop to flatten a list of lists into a single list. For example, [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]] should become [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
# 6. Create a program that removes duplicates from a list of integers using a while loop and returns the list without duplicates.
# 7. Write a Python program that merges two lists of numbers, sorts them in ascending order, and prints the merged list.
# 8. Given a list of numbers, write a Python program to find and print the second largest number using both a while loop and a for loop.
# 9. Using the list `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, write a Python program that doubles every number in the list using a for loop and prints the new list.
# 10. Write a Python program that checks if a list of strings contains a specific word using a for loop and prints "Found" or "Not Found".
# 11. Create a program that finds all prime numbers in a given list of integers using a for loop and returns a new list of prime numbers.
# 12. Given a list of integers, write a Python program to check if any element in the list is divisible by 3 using a while loop.
# 13. Write a Python program that reads a list of strings, converts all strings to uppercase, and returns the modified list.
# 14. Create a program that finds the intersection of two lists of numbers (common elements) using list comprehensions.
# 15. Write a program that simulates the Fibonacci sequence using a list and a while loop. Print the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
# 16. Using list comprehensions, write a Python program that generates a list of squares of all odd numbers in a given list of integers.
# 17. Create a program that uses a for loop to iterate through a list of tuples and sorts the list based on the second value of each tuple.
# 18. Write a Python program that counts how many times a specific element (e.g., a string or number) appears in a list of elements.
# 19. Given a list of numbers, write a Python program that moves all zeros in the list to the end while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements.
# 20. Write a program that checks if a given list of integers is a palindrome using a while loop. Print "Palindrome" or "Not Palindrome".
# 21. Using Python‚Äôs `collections` library, write a program that finds the frequency of each element in a list and prints the result.
# 22. Write a Python program that sorts a list of strings in reverse order using the `sorted()` function, and returns the sorted list.
# 23. Using the `itertools` library, write a Python program that generates all possible pairs (combinations) of elements from a given list.
# 24. Write a Python program that removes the first occurrence of a specified element from a list using the `remove()` method and prints the modified list.
# 25. Create a program that finds the most frequent item in a list and returns the item along with its frequency using the `Counter` class from the `collections` library.
# 26. Given a list of numbers, write a Python program that returns the list without any numbers greater than 100.
# 27. Using a while loop, write a Python program that generates a list of Fibonacci numbers and stores them in a list until the nth Fibonacci number exceeds 100.
# 28. Write a Python program that takes a list of strings and sorts them first by their length and then alphabetically.
# 29. Given a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two numbers, write a Python program to sort the list based on the first number of each tuple.
# 30. Write a Python program that uses the `zip()` function to merge two lists element by element and prints the resulting list of tuples.
