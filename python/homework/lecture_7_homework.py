# At the top the file write you git user id ex: "@sumit-dev-01"
# 1. When you start your assignment, make sure you have to record your current work. If you on any system like windows or mac, you have start your screen recording.
# 2. Submit your work to "origin/assignments"
# 3. Submit your recording to "sumitpaul@cloudadda.net"
# 4. Follow this procedures to get a classmate note book üìí, if you successfully completed that assignment
# 5. When you start you assignment don't shift to another window, do not open any lecture file. Just answer the question, and submit your assignment to early mentioned destination.
# 6. Submit your raw recorded file, make sure that is not modified or edited...edited file not accepted üö´
# 7. When you write your code and run that successfully, then "comment off" that code so that code would be ignored by python interpreter, when you run your next code. Because you can write multiple types of code on a single file. And saved your work securely because your code is checked by me" 


## QUESTIONS:-

# 1. Given a file "data.txt" containing a list of student names, write a Python program to open the file in read mode and print each student's name line by line.
# 2. Explain the difference between "r", "w", "a", and "x" file modes in Python. Provide a practical example for each mode.
# 3. Write a Python program to create a new file "example.txt" and write the text "Python programming is fun!" into it using the 'w' mode.
# 4. Create a program to append the text "Let's learn together." to an existing file "data.txt" using the 'a' mode. Verify the result by reading the file.
# 5. Write a Python program that opens a file "sample.txt" in read mode. If the file doesn't exist, it should print an error message without crashing.
# 6. Using the "with" statement, write a Python program to open and read the contents of a file "info.txt", then print the number of words in the file.
# 7. Write a Python program to read a file "logs.txt" line by line. If the line contains the word "error", print that line.
# 8. Demonstrate the usage of "continue" and "break" statements in a program that reads through a file and processes each line, stopping if the word "exit" is found.
# 9. Write a program that uses a "while" loop to read a file "input.txt" line by line. If a line starts with "skip", use the "continue" statement to skip that line.
# 10. Write a Python program that searches for a specific word "Python" in a file "programming.txt" and prints the line numbers where it is found.
# 11. Given a file "data.csv" containing comma-separated values, write a program to read and print the second column of each line in the file.
# 12. Write a Python program that reads a file "textfile.txt" and counts how many lines in the file contain the word "Python".
# 13. Use the "in" keyword to search for the presence of the word "error" in each line of a file "server_log.txt". Print the lines where "error" appears.
# 14. Write a program that uses the "in" operator to check if the word "success" exists in a file "results.txt". Print "Found" if it exists, else "Not Found".
# 15. Create a Python program that reads from "input.txt" and prints the contents of the file, replacing every instance of "foo" with "bar".
# 16. Write a Python program that reads from a file "numbers.txt" and prints out the sum of all the numbers in the file. Assume the file contains one number per line.
# 17. Write a Python program that opens a file "notes.txt", reads its contents, and adds a tab character before each line, then writes the modified contents to "new_notes.txt".
# 18. In a file "sentences.txt", add a new line character after every sentence. Write the modified content into a new file "new_sentences.txt".
# 19. Write a Python program that reads a file "data.txt", replaces all white spaces with underscores, and writes the result to a new file "modified_data.txt".
# 20. Write a Python program to search for the word "Python" in a file "example.txt" and print the lines where the word is found, along with its line number.
# 21. Create a program that reads a file "contacts.txt" line by line and prints each line with no leading or trailing whitespace characters.
# 22. Write a Python program that uses the try and except block to handle the error that occurs when trying to open a file "non_existent_file.txt".
# 23. Create a program that reads through a file "messages.txt" and prints each line. If a line causes an error, use the try-except block to continue reading the file.
# 24. Write a Python program that attempts to open a file "data.txt". If the file is not found, print "File not found" without crashing the program.
# 25. Demonstrate the use of the "try" and "except" blocks in a program that reads from a file "text.txt". If an error occurs, handle the error and display an appropriate message.
# 26. Given a file "shopping_list.txt", write a Python program that removes leading and trailing whitespaces from each line and stores the cleaned data in "cleaned_list.txt".
# 27. Write a Python program that opens a file "user_data.txt", reads each line, and prints it with each word capitalized.
# 28. Create a Python program that opens a file "report.txt" in read mode and prints every 3rd character from the file's content.
# 29. Write a Python program that uses the "in" operator to check whether the string "important" is present in each line of a file "notes.txt". If it is, print the line.
# 30. Create a program that opens a file "input.txt", reads all its content using the `read()` method, and prints the content, counting the number of characters in it.
