# At the top the file write you git user id ex: "@sumit-dev-01"
# 1. When you start your assignment, make sure you have to record your current work. If you on any system like windows or mac, you have start your screen recording.
# 2. Submit your work to "origin/assignments"
# 3. Submit your recording to "sumitpaul@cloudadda.net"
# 4. Follow this procedures to get a classmate note book üìí, if you successfully completed that assignment
# 5. When you start you assignment don't shift to another window, do not open any lecture file. Just answer the question, and submit your assignment to early mentioned destination.
# 6. Submit your raw recorded file, make sure that is not modified or edited...edited file not accepted üö´
# 7. When you write your code and run that successfully, then "comment off" that code so that code would be ignored by python interpreter, when you run your next code. Because you can write multiple types of code on a single file. And saved your work securely because your code is checked by me"

# 40. Using Pandas, write a program to read a CSV file, create a pivot table from the DataFrame, and export the result to a new CSV file.

# 41. Given an unstructured JSON-like dataset representing a chatbot's conversation logs, write a Python function that:
# 
# 1. Reads the unstructured data (captured from an AI's interaction).
# 2. Structures it into a more readable format (e.g., a pandas DataFrame or a SQL-compatible table).
# 3. Handles missing values and ensures that the resulting data is clean and standardized (e.g., timestamps in ISO format, consistent user-agent information).
# 4. Stores the structured data in a database or a CSV file for further analysis.
#
# The unstructured data might look something like this:
# 
# unstructured_data = [
#     {"timestamp": "2024-12-13T10:01:00", "user": "John", "message": "Hi there!"},
#     {"timestamp": "2024-12-13T10:01:30", "user": "AI", "message": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"},
#     {"timestamp": "2024-12-13T10:02:00", "user": "John", "message": "I need help with data science."},
#     {"timestamp": None, "user": "AI", "message": "Sure! What specific topic are you interested in?"}
# ]
#
# After the function execution, the structured data should be in a tabular form where each interaction (timestamp, user, message) is clearly represented and stored.
#
# Example of structured output (in CSV format or SQL database):
# 
# | Timestamp            | User  | Message                                            |
# |----------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------|
# | 2024-12-13T10:01:00  | John  | Hi there!                                          |
# | 2024-12-13T10:01:30  | AI    | Hello! How can I assist you today?                 |
# | 2024-12-13T10:02:00  | John  | I need help with data science.                     |
# | 2024-12-13T10:02:30  | AI    | Sure! What specific topic are you interested in?   |
# 
# The final goal is to make AI conversation logs more interpretable and structured for analysis.
