# ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements of assignments ‚ö†Ô∏è
# At the top the file write you git user id ex: "@sumit-dev-01"
# 1. When you start your assignment, make sure you have to record your current work. If you on any system like windows or mac, you have start your screen recording.
# 2. Submit your work to "origin/assignments"
# 3. Submit your recording to "sumitpaul@cloudadda.net"
# 4. Follow this procedures to get a classmate note book, if you successfully completed that assignment
# 5. When you start you assignment don't shift to another window, do not open any lecture file. Just answer the question, and submit your assignment to early mentioned destination.
# 6. Submit your raw recorded file, make sure that is not modified or edited...edited file not accepted üö´
# 7. When you write your code and run that successfully, then "comment off" that code so that code would be ignored by python interpreter, when you run your next code. Because you can write multiple types of code on a single file. And saved your work securely because your code is checked by me" 

# Q.1 What is constant?
# Create a file called assignment_2.py and write
#
# Q.2 Prove strings are immutable with examples
# Brainstorming üß†
# Don't use repo code, use your creativity
# Ex: 1 - through TypeErro 
# Ex: 2 - that successfully executed
# Use f-string for explanation
#
# Q.3  We can't slice integers like string, if that is true then prove it?
#
# x = 343544
# if "true" then extract: 35
#
# Q.4 Change Euler's number: float to str then back to float 
#
# E = 2.72 | E = 2.73(convert to that)
# - Purpose of capitalized "E"
# - suppose you're a programmer what's your job in well designed documented code, so that your code understandable for eveyone. 
#
# hint: suppose i use small "e" then what's gone wrong in programming lifecycle
#
# Q.5 Where need data manipulation?
# 
# Q.6 Variable naming rules in python?
#
# Q7. Scenario: Build application for Amazon Warehouse
# You work in a software development company that has built an application for an Amazon warehouse. The application tracks the daily performance of employees, including how many packets each employee packs.

# Task:
# Suman, an employee, packed 379 packets in one day. Using the application, calculate Suman‚Äôs total income for the day. rate 55.43/10packets pack.
#
# Q.8 Explain Operator Precedence Rule?
#
# Q.9 Difference between Percedence Rule and BODMAD rule?  
# 
# Q.10 Solve this equation?
# x = 5 + 6 * 4 - 3 / 2 ** 3
#
# don't do that "print(x)"
# Show all the steps according Operator Precedence Rule
# print(5**6)
# print(2*3)
# x = 1 + 6 - 4 / 15625
# print(4/15625)
# x = 1 + 6 - 0.000256
# print(1 + 6)
# print(7 - 0.000256)
#
# After write that then execute "print(x)"
# Your hand written code should match with "print(x)"
#
# Q.11 True/Flase
# - Can we convert "sfsa" str to int
# - Can we convert "sff" str to float
# - Can we convert "23.34" float to str
# - can we convert "234" str to int
# - can we convert "334" str to float
#
# Q.12 Create a program with input()
#
