# ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements of assignments ‚ö†Ô∏è
# At the top the file write you git user id ex: "@sumit-dev-01"
# 1. When you start your assignment, make sure you have to record your current work. If you on any system like windows or mac, you have start your screen recording.
# 2. Submit your work to "origin/assignments"
# 3. Submit your recording to "sumitpaul@cloudadda.net"
# 4. Follow this procedures to get a classmate note book üìí, if you successfully completed that assignment
# 5. When you start you assignment don't shift to another window, do not open any lecture file. Just answer the question, and submit your assignment to early mentioned destination.
# 6. Submit your raw recorded file, make sure that is not modified or edited...edited file not accepted üö´
# 7. When you write your code and run that successfully, then "comment off" that code so that code would be ignored by python interpreter, when you run your next code. Because you can write multiple types of code on a single file. And saved your work securely because your code is checked by me" 


# QUESTIONS:-

# 1. Write a Python program to create a tuple of integers and find the second largest element without using built-in functions like sorted().
# 2. Create a tuple with duplicate elements and write a program to count the frequency of each element using a dictionary.
# 3. Given a tuple of strings, write a program to filter out strings that have a length less than 4 characters. Return the result as a new tuple.
# 4. Write a program to merge two tuples into a single tuple and sort the resulting tuple in reverse alphabetical order without converting it to a list.
# 5. Given a nested tuple, write a Python program to extract all unique elements and store them in a set.
# 6. Write a program to convert a tuple of tuples into a single dictionary where the first element of each inner tuple is the key and the second element is the value.
# 7. Given a tuple of integers, write a program to calculate the cumulative sum of its elements and return the result as a new tuple.
# 8. Write a Python program to check if two tuples are disjoint (no common elements). If not, print the common elements.
# 9. Create a tuple of file paths and write a program to filter out the paths that end with '.txt'. Return the result as a new tuple.
# 10. Given a tuple of dates in string format (e.g., '2024-12-13'), write a program to sort them in chronological order.
# 11. Write a Python program to unpack a tuple of N elements into two parts: the first three elements and the rest, and print both parts.
# 12. Create a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple represents a student's name and grades. Write a program to calculate the average grade for each student and return a new tuple of averages.
# 13. Write a program to reverse a tuple of integers without using slicing.
# 14. Given a tuple of tuples, write a program to flatten it into a single tuple using only loops (no list comprehension or built-in functions).
# 15. Create a tuple of Numpy arrays. Write a program to calculate the mean of all elements in each array and store the results in a new tuple.
# 16. Write a Python program to perform element-wise addition of two tuples of integers. If the tuples are of unequal lengths, pad the shorter tuple with zeros.
# 17. Create a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple represents a product's name and price. Write a program to find the product with the maximum price and print its name.
# 18. Given a tuple of strings, write a program to create a new tuple where each string is reversed.
# 19. Write a program to compare two tuples element by element and create a third tuple containing the larger element at each index.
# 20. Given a tuple of dictionaries, write a program to merge all the dictionaries into a single dictionary.
