# At the top the file write you git user id ex: "@sumit-dev-01"
# 1. When you start your assignment, make sure you have to record your current work. If you on any system like windows or mac, you have start your screen recording.
# 2. Submit your work to "origin/assignments"
# 3. Submit your recording to "sumitpaul@cloudadda.net"
# 4. Follow this procedures to get a classmate note book üìí, if you successfully completed that assignment
# 5. When you start you assignment don't shift to another window, do not open any lecture file. Just answer the question, and submit your assignment to early mentioned destination.
# 6. Submit your raw recorded file, make sure that is not modified or edited...edited file not accepted üö´
# 7. When you write your code and run that successfully, then "comment off" that code so that code would be ignored by python interpreter, when you run your next code. Because you can write multiple types of code on a single file. And saved your work securely because your code is checked by me" 

## QUESTIONS:-

# 1. Given the string s = "abcdefghij", extract the substring "dce" using string slicing.
# 2. Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the substring from the 5th to the 2nd last character.
# 3. What is the output of the following code?
#    s = "Hello, World!"
#    print(s[::2])
# 4. Extract the last 3 characters of a string without using negative indices.
# 5. Write a function that accepts a string and slices it into 3 equal parts. Return the middle part.
# 6. Given the string s = "abcdefghijkl", extract every 3rd character starting from the second character.
# 7. What is the result of the following slicing operation on the string s = "Programming"?
#    print(s[3:7][::-1])
# 8. Given two strings, s1 = "abcdef" and s2 = "cde", check if s2 is a substring of s1 using the "in" operator.
# 9. Create a function that checks if any word in a list appears more than once in a string, using the "in" operator.
# 10. Write a function that checks if a substring appears in a string at least twice, using "in".
# 11. Given the string text = "Python is a versatile language!", write a program that checks if both "Python" and "language" exist in the string using "in".
# 12. What is the output of the following code?
#    text = "The quick brown fox"
#    print('quick' in text and 'lazy' not in text)
# 13. Concatenate the strings "Python", "is", and "fun!" without using the + operator. Use slicing or another concatenation method.
# 14. Given two strings, str1 = "hello" and str2 = "world", create a new string new_str that alternates characters from both strings, starting with the first character of str1.
# 15. Write a Python function that takes a list of strings, concatenates them, and then slices the result to only return the first 10 characters.
