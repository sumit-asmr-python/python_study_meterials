# At the top the file write you git user id ex: "@sumit-dev-01"
# 1. When you start your assignment, make sure you have to record your current work. If you on any system like windows or mac, you have start your screen recording.
# 2. Submit your work to "origin/assignments"
# 3. Submit your recording to "sumitpaul@cloudadda.net"
# 4. Follow this procedures to get a classmate note book üìí, if you successfully completed that assignment

# 6. Submit your raw recorded file, make sure that is not modified or edited...edited file not accepted üö´
# 7. When you write your code and run that successfully, then "comment off" that code so that code would be ignored by python interpreter, when you run your next code. Because you can write multiple types of code on a single file. And saved your work securely because your code is checked by me"
